My code implements a simple contact management system using Python, allowing users to add, view, search, update, and delete contacts stored in a JSON file. 
It provides a user-friendly interface for managing contacts efficiently. 
The system ensures data persistence across sessions and supports partial name searches. 
Overall, it offers a basic yet functional contact book application.
